# Heatmap Calendar plugin for Obsidian

Visualise your data in a full year heatmap calendar similar to the github activity calendar using this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin.  

Useful for tracking your progress for various things such as exercise, finance, passion, vice, social, project progression etc.   

Tracking and visualizing the data can help motivate you to start doing the things you want to do, or even more – motivate you to continue once you've started!

It's intended to be used alongside [DataviewJS](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/), but could be used standalone or with other plugins as well, as all the plugin does, is add the function ***renderHeatmapCalendar()*** to the global namespace.

## Use:

1. Annotate the data you want to track in your daily notes (see [Dataview annotation documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/)) 
2. Create a [DataviewJS block](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/) wherever you want the Heatmap Calendar to display.  
3. Collect the data you want to display using [DataviewJS](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/)
4. Pass the data into Heatmap Calendar using  **renderHeatmapCalendar()**

## Full Example Code:

~~~javascript
\```dataviewjs
const calendarData = { 
	entries: [], // Populated in the DataviewJS loop below
	year: 2022,  // (optional) Defaults to current year
  gridColor: "#2a2a2a", // (optional) Defaults to "#ffffff"
	colors: {    // (optional) Defaults to green
	  blue:        ["#8cb9ff","#69a3ff","#428bff","#1872ff","#0058e2"], // first entry is considered default if supplied
	  green:       ["#c6e48b","#7bc96f","#49af5d","#2e8840","#196127"],
	  red:         ["#ff9e82","#ff7b55","#ff4d1a","#e73400","#bd2a00"],
	  orange:      ["#ffa244","#fd7f00","#dd6f00","#bf6000","#9b4e00"],
	  pink:        ["#ff96cb","#ff70b8","#ff3a9d","#ee0077","#c30062"],
	  orangeToRed: ["#ffdf04","#ffbe04","#ff9a03","#ff6d02","#ff2c01"]
	}
}

//DataviewJS loop
for(let page of dv.pages('"daily notes"').where(p=>p.exercise).sort(p=>p.file.name)){ 

	calendarData.entries.push({
		date: page.file.name, // (required) Format YYYY-MM-DD
		intensity: page.exercise, // (required) Color intensity for entry, will map intensities automatically
		content: "🏋️", // (optional) Add text to the date cell
		color: "orange", // (optional) Reference from *calendarData.colors*. If no color is supplied; colors[0] is used
	})

}

/**
* param1  HTMLElement   DOM reference for calendar rendering
* param2  CalendarData  Calendar data object from above
*/
renderHeatmapCalendar(this.container, calendarData)
```
~~~

  
## Colors:
You don't need to supply any colors, the calendar uses green by default, just like Github.   
If you do supply colors to *calendarData.colors*, the first index will be considered the new default color.

Add a custom color to each entry by specifying the name you gave the color in calendarData.colors.
You can even use multiple colors in the same calendar, just use different colors for different entries.  
   
The color schemes used in the examples were created at [leonardocolor.io](https://leonardocolor.io).

## Intensity:
The "Intensity" means which intensity of color to use, for instance from light-green to dark-green.  
The plugin currently supports five intensities, and they will be distributed between the highest and lowest number you pass to "intensity".  
If the number range 0-100 is used, numbers between 1-20 would map to the ligthest color, 40-60 would map to mid intensity color, and 80-100 would map to max intensity.  

Dataview's time variables are supported without any conversion, as they return milliseconds by default.  
**[time:: 1 hours, 35 minutes] => intensity: page.time**

## Notes:
- See the [EXAMPLE VAULT](https://github.com/Richardsl/heatmap-calendar-obsidian/tree/master/EXAMPLE_VAULT) if you want to test out the examples.
- Week starts on Monday, not configurable yet
- Date format is YYYY-MM-DD, if your daily note filename is something else, [you can use JS to change it in the loop](https://github.com/Richardsl/heatmap-calendar-obsidian/discussions/2)
